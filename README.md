# Drug-Methods-of-Action

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to find a relationship between drug attributes and their corresponding methods of action

The csv files used in this project can be found in the [Kaggle LISH-MOA Data Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/data)

Each drug experiment contains roughly 600 features related to genetic expression and 200 related to chemical attributes. A new model is made for each method of action and predicts the results as a function of how likely a given drug is to express an MOA. This is an incredibly useful tool which could allow researchers to predict a drug's viability and MOAs. This could improve the efficiency of the drug development process by selectively eliminating drug candidates which are unlikely to be viable before moving on to the screening and preclinical trial phases of development.

## Implementation
