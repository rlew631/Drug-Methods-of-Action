# Drug-Methods-of-Action

The purpose of this project is to find a relationship between drug attributes and their corresponding methods of action

Each drug experiment contains roughly 600 features related to genetic expression and 200 related to chemical attributes. A new model is made for each method of action and predicts the results as a function of how likely a given compound is to use each MOA
